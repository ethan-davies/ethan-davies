# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!
My name is Ethan Davies, and I am a student and a self-taught developer based in the United Kingdom. I'm always looking for new challenges and how to expand my knowledge, especially in terms of modern web technology and frameworks. I love working across the stack, with a specific interest in TypeScript and creating both frontend and backend solutions.

My main interest at the moment is Rend, a platform developed for game developers. Rend aims to simplify hosting, sharing, and publishing games, offering strong tools and a support community for creators of all kinds. I am excited to see the potential for Rend to bring developers' ideas to life.

If you wish to reach out or have a few questions, feel free to contact me at me@ethann.dev.
